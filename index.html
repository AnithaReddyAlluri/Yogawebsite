    <h1> YogaEveryday </h1>
    <h2>What is Yoga?</h2>
    <p>From the Sanskrit root "Yuj," which means "to join," "to yoke," or "to unite," comes the word "yoga." According to Yogic teachings, practicing yoga results in the unification of one's own consciousness with that of the universe, signifying complete harmony between the mind and body, as well as between man and nature.  </p>
    <h2>Benefits of Yoga</h2>
    <p>
       Yoga offers a range of profound advantages to those coping with paraplegia, providing a comprehensive approach to well-being that takes into account mental, emotional, and physical aspects. For those who suffer from lower limb paralysis, incorporating yoga into a thorough rehabilitation program can have life-changing effects and improve their overall quality of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yoga is an effective means of increasing range of motion and flexibility in the body. Yoga relieves the tightness and stiffness in the muscles that are frequently linked to paraplegia through a series of slow, deliberate stretches and movements. By progressively and safely increasing the body's range of motion, people can express themselves more freely and fluidly physically, which will help them go through everyday tasks more confidently and easily.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, yoga helps strengthen the arms, legs, and core, among other important muscle groups. In addition to improving stability and balance, these strength-training exercises are essential for promoting mobility and functional independence. Through the development of physical strength and resilience, yoga enables people to transcend physical constraints and lead more active and involved lives.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yoga has significant advantages for mental and emotional health in addition to its obvious physical ones. A greater sense of self-awareness and present-moment awareness can be developed by people through mindfulness-based activities like meditation and deep breathing exercises. Being mindfully aware provides a haven of peace in the face of life's obstacles and is a potent remedy for stress, anxiety, and depression.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      For people with paraplegia, yoga also offers a sense of community and acceptance. People can meet people who have similar experiences and difficulties by taking yoga classes that are catered to their individual needs and capabilities. People are inspired to embrace their innate strengths and abilities by this sense of camaraderie and mutual support, which cultivates a spirit of resilience and empowerment.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yoga is essentially a philosophy of holistic healing and self-discovery rather than just a set of physical postures or exercises. People who are paraplegics can recover their bodies, minds, and spirits by adopting the teachings of yoga and going on a profoundly transformative journey. With its focus on strength, flexibility, community, and awareness, yoga provides a route to revitalized energy.
